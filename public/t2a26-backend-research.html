Everything we have done with Javascript web page programming is called frontend coding. 
Backend coding is much more powerful but more confusing. Your job is to find the easiest backend cloud platform
which is still powerful and free.<br><br>

<h1>I researched</h1><br>
Render<br><br>

<h1>I tried</h1><br>
Render <br><br>

I am a pioneer of render, I knew this choice would most likely be superior since my brother<br>
someone who is working towards his degree in computer science is using this service<br>
if someone else in the class found something that Mr. Ellis liked more than render<br>
I would be glad to try it but there was no need.
