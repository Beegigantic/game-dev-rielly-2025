<br><br><li> can you make me a beginner friendly javascript leet code question?
  
<br><br><li> Given an array of numbers, return the second largest number in the array. If the array has fewer than two unique numbers, return null.

<br><br><li> Within PRE tags show your version of the leet answer without looking at the actual answer. <br>

<pre>
take the array go through it checking the biggest number found with the next number and if its
  bigger you keep that one and put the second largest in the second spot
    going through a loop you have the biggest number but you might not have
      the second largest. To get it you then check the second largest with every number except the largest one.
        This will give you the second largest then you print it.
  
</pre>

<input id="numbers" type="text" placeholder="Enter numbers separated by commas">
    <button onclick="showResult()">Find</button>
    <p>Second Largest: <span id="result"></span></p>

    <script>
      function secondLargest(arr) {
        if (arr.length < 2) return null;

        let largest = -Infinity;
        let second = -Infinity;

        for (let num of arr) {
          if (num > largest) {
            second = largest;
            largest = num;
          } else if (num > second && num < largest) {
            second = num;
          }
        }

        return second === -Infinity ? null : second;
      }

      function showResult() {
        const input = document.getElementById("numbers").value;
        const arr = input.split(",").map(x => Number(x.trim())).filter(x => !isNaN(x));
        const result = secondLargest(arr);
        document.getElementById("result").textContent = result;
      }
    </script>
